<p class="salad-words">Leafy green vegetables are nutrient rich because leaves contain the light-catching, energy-converting machinery of plants. Salad greens contain Vitamin A, Vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, folate, fiber, and phytonutrients. Leafy vegetables are a good choice for a healthful diet because they do not contain cholesterol and are naturally low in calories and sodium.</p>

<p class="pizza-words">The body uses protein to help with daily body functions. According to Amer, the average slice of pizza has about 12 grams of protein, largely coming from the cheese.

<h1 class="item-heading">Yami Burder:</h1>
<div class="burger-section">
<img class="burger-image" src="cafe4.jpg" alt="loading...." />
<p class="burger-words">Burgers have a terrible reputation. High in fat and calories, they may be the first food scratched off your menu when you decide to eat healthily. Before you rule out burgers for good, take a look at some of the health benefits they can deliver. If eaten only on occasion, burgers, especially those made with lean ground beef, can boost your health rather than impair it. Though people say itâ€™s bad for health, there is a scientific reason to love and eat the burger as there are many health benefits of the burger.</p>

<h1 class="item-heading">Hot Coffee:</h1>
<div class="coffee-section">
<img class="coffee-image" src="cafe5.jpg" alt="loading..." />
<p class="coffee-words">When people think of coffee, they usually think of its ability to provide an energy boost. However, according to some research, it can also offer some other important health benefits, such as a lower risk of liver cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure.</p>
